# Software Engineering
- Application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
    - That is, the application of engineering to software.
    - IEEE Standard 610.12-1990
- Concerned with theories, methods and tools that enable professional software development.

"The topic that we call software engineering is both exciting and frustrating. Exciting because it draws on many technical disciplines and provides a harness that binds each discipline to the next. Frustrating, because it demands knowledge in a multitude of topic areas and seems to be infinitely expandable." - Roger Pressman, 1992

# Software Engineering Process
A structured set of activities followed to develop a software system

- Tools
- Methods
- Practices

## Well Engineered Software
- Usable
- Dependable
- Maintainable
- Efficient
- How do costs come into this?
    - Trade-offs may be involved
        - appropriate
        - cost-effective

# Process Models
- Abstract representation of a process
- Plan Driven
    - Structured / Traditional
- Incremental
- Agile
- Lean
- Formal

- Process framework
    - process is instantiated from the framework
    - metamodel documents the framework
- Contracts between components
    - process construction
    - scheduling

## Agile Processes
- Scrum, XP, FDD, DSDM
- Embrace change
    - Requirements are never fixed
    - Stop pretending and get used to it
- Deliver early and deliver often
    - A working system delivers value
    - A deployed system generates revenue

## Lean Development
- More a philosophy than a process
    - Think Big
    - Act Small
    - Fail Fast
- Eliminate Waste
- Amplify Learning
- Decide as Late as Possible
- Deliver as Fast as Possible
- Empower the Team
- Build Integrity In
- See the Whole 

## Formal Processes
- Application of mathematical formality to software development
    - formal specification
    - transformation of specification to code

# Process
- All SE Processes involved phases
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Development (implementation, coding)
    - Testing (Verification)
    - Delivery and Maintenance
- These are never disjoint, never just sequential
- We iterate between them, and we blur the distinctions because we want to get it right
- Software Engineering cannot work without a defined development process
    - anything else is randomised hacking
- Processes cannot work if they are not usable
    - people don't read telephone books cover to cover
- Good processes should engage the team
    - support technical excellence and innovation
    - embed a culture of trust and responsibility

# Standards
- Rules, guidelines and heuristics
- De facto -- implicit agreement
    - easily changed
- De jure -- formal agreement
    - usually debated and documented

## Standard Adoption
- Voluntary
    - achieving good practice
    - safety net
- Required
    - demands of clients
    - certification requirements
    - follow on from other standards
    - process improvement activity

# What is Requirements Engineering
- Requirements engineering is a term often used for a systematic approach to acquire, analyse, validate, document and manage requirements
- Typically implemented as a cyclic or iterative process
- Requirements validation may include prototype construction and evaluation
- Applied at both system and software levels, often with interleaved system architecture design

## What is a Requirement?
1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
2. A condition by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed document
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2

- There is a relationship between the quality / cost / timeliness / etc. of the product and the quality of the process
- Both functional and non-functional requirements are essential for successful software
    - Both must be verified
        - Consequently they must be testable
            - Non-functional Requirements should be measurable

## Requirements Engineering Products
- Primary outcome is a requirements specification
    - Essentially a contract between user and developer
    - Basis for all subsequent development and verification processes
- Secondary outcome is usually system and software acceptance test criteria

## Why is RE important?
- Most faults observed in a software project are from incorrect, incomplete, or misinterpreted functional specifications or requirements
- Helps earlier detection of mistakes, which are much more costly to correct if discovered later
- Forces clients to articulate and review requirements
- Enhances communications between participants
- Helps record and refine requirements
- All this is about producing good requirements

## Advice/Perspective
- â€¦ a systematic approach to finding, documenting, organizing, and tracking the changing requirements of a system
- In practice it is impossible to produce a complete and consistent requirements document
- Getting the requirements right is critical for success
- Requirements are rarely right at the start of a large project
    - Expect change
    - Manage it
    - Agile mantra "Embrace Change"

## Functional Requirements
- Requirements (or capabilities) for functions (specific behaviour) that must be performed by the system
    - e.g. read a bar code, change a user name
- Primary focus of most requirements activities

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Constraints on performance or quality

### Product Properties
- Requirements on the behaviour of the product
    - System shall process a minimum of 8 transactions per second
    - User credit card details shall be secured

### Process Properties
- Requirements on the practices used to develop / produce the system
    - Control software shall be verified in accordance with IEEE STD 1012-1998

## Classification of Non-Functional Requirements
According to the ISO standard

- Safety requirements
- Security requirements
- Interface requirements
- Human engineering requirements
- Qualification requirements
- Operational requirements
- Maintenance requirements
- Design constraints

## Sources of Requirements
- Users
    - e.g. customers or end-users -- user requirements
- Other Stakeholders
    - e.g. marketing experts, regulators, managers, business owners, developers
- Non-Human Sources
    - e.g. other devices or systems in the environment

## Summary
- Requirements engineering is concerned with eliciting, analysing, documenting, validating and managing requirements
- The process, and the specification it produces, is the primary link between the user and the system developer
- The requirements specification is also the basis for all subsequent development activity, and must guide all decisions that determine the resultant product quality
- Requirements engineering is the key to product quality

# Project Charter
## Vision Statement
- Long term purpose of system
    - a bit idealistic
- For -- target audience
- Who -- statement of need
- The -- product
- Is -- category
- That -- reason to use
- Unlike -- alternative
- Out Product -- advantage

## Goals
- High-level
- What project will accomplish

## Objectives
- Specific
- Supports a goal
    - think "how" it does this
- Describe with an action verb
    - measurable
    - address project end result

## SMART
- Specific
    - what is to be accomplished
    - only essential aspects
- Measurable
    - need success/completion criteria
- Agreed-upon
    - common understanding amongst stakeholders

    - by end of project
    - releases determined later
- What is explicitly out of scope
    - does not relate to business benefit

## Stakeholders
- Sponsor
- Influencers
- Users
    - key
    - restricted
    - super

# Business Value Not System Requirements
## Understanding the Business
- Developers and Stakeholders need a shared understanding of the project's purpose
    - easier when they collaborate continuously
- Focus on value to be delivered
    - not just the requirements
- Enables better decisions, designs and suggestions
    - developers are part of the value chain
        - not just serving it

## Business Model
A business model describes the rationale of how an organisation creates, delivers, and captures value

~~~
digraph {
  Preparation -> Elicitation -> Analysis -> Specification -> Preparation;
}
~~~

### Preparation -- Sources of Requirements
- Stakeholders
- Users
- Environment
    - application domain
    - organisation
    - operations
        - other system dependencies
            - interface requirements
            - timing constraints
        - execution environment
            - platform
            - reliability and performance
        - criticality
            - mission
            - safety

### Know Your Users -- User Role Modelling
- What types of people will use the system?
- Don't think of an anonymous user
- Identify different user roles
    - brainstorm initial set
    - group related roles
    - consolidate roles
    - refine roles
- Don't get stuck on organisational roles

## Elicitation Challenges
- Stakeholders and users may not be able to describe their tasks well
    - make assumptions and leave things unstated
- No-one knows everything
- Requirements conflict
- Implicit requirements

## Elicitation Techniques
### Interviews
- Effective for understanding problem and eliciting _general_ requirements
- Prepare questions in advance
    - discussion needs a starting point
    - primarily open-ended questions
    - strawman model if you have some data
- Suggest ideas and alternatives
    - users may not realise what is possible
- Active listening
    - paraphrase what you understand
- Clarify what's unclear
- Maintain focus

### Workshops
- Structured meeting
    - formal roles
    - clear goals
- Multiple stakeholders
    - resolve conflicting requirements
    - quickly gather broad system usage

### Focus Groups
- Less structure
    - still need clear goals
- Exploratory discussion
    - needs
    - preferences
    - expectations
- Broad stakeholder representation
- Gather broad-based ideas

### Observations
- Observe how users perform their tasks
- Users often cannot describe everything they do
    - too many fine details or habitual tasks
- Time consuming
    - silent observation
    - interactive

### Questionnaires
- Inexpensive and easily administered to remote sites
- Collect data from many users
- May feed into interviews or workshops
- Good questionnaires difficult to write

## Independent Elicitation Techniques
- Discover information on your own

### System Interface Analysis
- Look at other system's functionality
- Data exchange
    - including formats and validation rules
- Services

### User Interface Analysis
- Study existing systems
- What should be replicated and avoided
- Good way to learn existing system and processes

### Document Analysis
- Business process descriptions
- Existing system documentation
- Industry standards or legislation
- Gain understanding of domain or system

# Requirements Modelling
## Product vs User Centred
### Product-Centred
- Focus on features to be delivered
    - expect users will use features to complete tasks

### User-Centred
- Focus on anticipated usage
    - what do users need to accomplish
- Reveal necessary functionality
- Assists with prioritisation

# Use Case Modelling
- Models and documents the functional requirements of a problem domain
- Results in the production of the
    - functional requirements
    - which are the detailed, role based, functional account of the requirements

## Why Use Cases?
- Formalises users' expectations of what the system is to do and how the system is to be used
- Easy technique to understand
    - documents actual paths through the system
- User-driven process
    - encourages user involvement
- Basis for scoping and prioritising development work
- Basis for acceptance testing
- Well aligned with Business Process Modelling

## What is a Use Case?
- A way to use the system
- Externally required functionality
- What the system does
    - not how it does it
- Specify the behaviour of a use case as a flow of events

## Actors, Use Cases and Association
Actors
: things outside of the system that interact with the system

Use Cases
: features of the system that an actor uses

Associations
: indicates a relationship between an actor and a use case

### Actors
- Everything that interacts with the system
- Not described in detail (they're outside of system)
- Normally act in several use cases
- Represents a role that a user can play
    - many users are represented by a single actor
    - one user can be different actors at different times

#### Actors are External to System
- Make sure that actors are people or other systems that would actually use the system
- The system does not use itself

### Primary and Secondary Actors
- Primary actors are those actors that the system is designed to serve
    - Main users of the system
- Secondary actors are support roles
    - secondary actors only exist so that primary actors can use the system

### \<\<include\>\> Relationship
- Factor out common behaviour in use cases
    - sequence of steps appearing in multiple use cases
- Scenario always uses the included steps
    - included steps do not have to be a complete use case

### \<\<extend\>\> Relationship
- Factors out optional behaviour in use cases
    - used when a scenario produces a different result in certain situations
        - when there are optional or uncommon steps that may occur
- The extended scenario may be completed without including the steps from the extending use case
    - removes the need to have many primary scenarios to capture the optional paths of a use case
- Delivery of extending use cases can occur in later phases of development

#### Extension Point
- Included in the use case description to indicate the point at which the extending use case begins
    - condition that causes the extension is highlighted
- Scenario for the base use case runs as normal until the extension point
- Under certain conditions the extending use case then begins and runs to completion
- Base use case then resumes

## Use Cases Limitations
- Interaction focus
    - usage scenarios
- Not suitable
    - batch processing
    - complex business rules
    - computationally intensive
    - real-time systems
    - embedded systems

# Activity Diagram
- Shows the steps involved in performing a task
- Special form of state diagram
- Describes a complex task for objects of a class, operations, or use cases
    - focuses on internal processing
    - use where all the events represent the completion of internally generated actions
    - use state diagrams where asynchronous events occur

## Activity Diagrams in Use Case Modelling
- Determine triggering event that starts use case flow
- Identify actions and determine control flow
- Add guard conditions and decision points
- Add forking and joining to show parallel activity
- Create invoke activities if complexity requires it
- Group activities into partitions if needed
- Add flows corresponding to alternative scenarios
- Each path should correspond to an individual scenario

# User Stories
- Short description of functionality
- From the user's perspective
- Provides value to the user or customer
    - consider both types of clients
- Must be testable
- Provides enough information for developers to make rough estimates

# Prioritisation
## First Things First
- Rank high value use cases so they are delivered first
- Create shared understanding of how use cases contribute to business objectives
- Leads to estimation and release planning

## Prioritisation Activities
- Driven by customer representatives
    - may require a team facilitator
    - may require a few iterations
- Verify results against agreed success criteria

## Setting Priorities
- MoSCoW
    - Must have
    - Should have
    - Could have
    - Wont have

## Prioritisation Process
- Conducted in a workshop
    - customer representatives
    - developers
- Write use case names on index cards
- Group cards on table / wall
- Review and revise

## Prioritisation Factors
- Importance of actor
    - broad base of key users
    - small group of important stakeholders
- Importance of use cases to actor
- Cohesiveness of functionality
    - does use case relate to other higher priority use cases
- Dependencies between use cases
- Risk involved in implementing use case

## Prioritisation Strategies
- Performed by the development team
    - customer _decides_ on priorities
    - developers provide input
- Deliver important business value early
- Focus on the Must Haves vs the rest
- Split use cases with mixed priorities

# Software Review
## What is a Software Review?
- Generic term for a variety of techniques for evaluating software development products
    - Collaborative
    - Common aim to detect errors and improve software quality
- Can be applied to any product
    - requirements
    - design
    - code
    - test cases
- Checking for
    - completeness
    - consistency with other project documents
    - correctness
    - feasibility

## Review vs Testing
- **Reviews**
    - Concerned with analysis of the static system representation to discover problems
    - May be supplemented by tool-based document and code analysis
- **Testing**
    - Concerned with exercising and observing product behaviour
    - System is executed with test data and its operational behaviour is observed

## Benefits of Reviews
- Complexity of software development means major cost benefits from early detection of errors
- Can be applied earlier and to untestable products
    - requirements specifications, design documents, test plans, â€¦
- Incomplete versions of a system can be inspected without additional costs
    - incomplete programs require specialized test harnesses
- During testing, errors can mask (hide) other errors
    - inspection is a static process
- Reduce rework -- improves schedule performance
- Author receives timely feedback on defects
- Provides project management status (milestones)
- Can also consider broader quality attributes
    - e.g. compliance with standards, portability, maintainability
- Collaboration in reviews motivates better work
    - distributes expertise and helps team building
- Helps subsequent maintenance
    - documentation exists and is consistent

## Limitations of Reviews
- Can check conformance with a specification
    - but not conformance with the customer's real requirements
- Cannot check non-functional characteristics
    - e.g. performance, usability

## Error Amplification
- Errors from previous activity
- Some errors are passed through
- Some get amplified
- New errors are generated
- Reviews filter out errors
- Errors passed on to next phase

## Types of Review
### Technical Review
- review for conformance to standards or achievement of project milestones
- led by team leader
- often management participation

### Software (Fagan) Inspection
- peer review with formal process
- led by independent moderator
- systematic data collection
- focus on defect detection and description
- process improvement goal

### Structured Walkthrough
- less formal than inspection
- usually led by producer
- no formal data collection
- no participant preparation

### Audit
- external review of work product
- independently managed
- usually late in the process

## Basic Inspection Principles
- Formal structured process with checklists and defined roles for participants
- Participants prepare in advance for meeting
- Focus is on identifying problems
    - not solving them
- Conducted by technical people for technical people
- Inspection data is recorded to monitor
    - effectiveness of the inspection process
    - relationships with product quality
- Looking for defects in product, not in developers

## Inspection Participants
### Moderator
- responsible for leading inspection process
- schedules and conducts review
- prepares reports and follows up action items

### Recorder
- keeps records of all significant inspection results
- help prepare reports

### Producer(s)
- responsible for work under review

### Reader
- presents work in lieu of producer in formal inspection

### Reviewers
- directly concerned with, and aware of work under review
- required to prepare for review
- should be objective and accountable

\
Inspection team typically between 3 and 7 people

## Inspection Process
### Request
- producer requests inspection of document
- moderator is selected

### Entry
- moderator checks document is ready

### Planning
- moderator plans inspection process

### Overview (optional)
- meeting to distribute documents

### Preparation
- participants work alone using checklists

### Inspection Meeting
- consolidate errors found by individual reviewers
- classify errors by severity for future analysis
- find additional errors via synergy

### Rework
- producer resolves issues from the meeting

### Follow-up
- moderator checks rework
- schedules additional inspection if needed

### Exit
- moderator checks document against exit criteria

### Release
- document is released

## Issue Classification
### Major
- defects that are likely to
    - cause incorrect behaviour, or
    - require external resolution before development can be completed

### Minor
- defects that are likely to cause limited or no loss of functionality

### Grammatical
- defects that are
    - spelling mistakes
    - grammar defects
    - typographical faults

### Questions
- potential defects that the reviewer is unsure about and which s/he wants to discuss at the meeting

## Inspection Preparation
- Product must be ready for inspection (entry criteria)
- Inspection team must be selected, briefed and supplied with review and source documents
- Checklists and standards give guidance to reviewers
- Reviewers must prepare individually, recording time and errors identified
- Reviewers may be given special roles
- Reviewers are seeking to find as many defects as possible
- Reviewers should concentrate on major defects
    - actual classification is not critical -- re-assessed at meeting
- Queries about the documents should be recorded for meeting
- Experience shows about 75% of all errors are typically located during individual preparation

## Reading Techniques
Ad-hoc
: rely on reviewers' knowledge and experience

Checklist
: focus on know problem types

Scenario-based
: assigns specific responsbilities for reviewers -- attempts to focus each reviewer on a different class of defects

Perspective-based
: enhanced version of scenario-based reading -- based on viewpoint or needs of stakeholders

Stepwise Abstraction
: reviewers derive specification from the code and then compare with original specification

# Non-Functional Requirements
- System properties and constraints
    - e.g. reliability, response time and storage requirements
- Non-functional requirements may be more critical than functional requirements

## NFR Sources
- Product requirements
    - behaviour constraints (execution speed, reliability, etc)
- Process requirements
    - restrictions on the development process (standards to follow, etc)
- External requirements

# Software Testing
There is a myth that if we were really good at programming there would be no bugs to catch

- If only we could really concentrate
- If only everyone used agile methods
- If programs were written in Scala
- If we had the right silver bullets

Then there would be no bugs. So goes the myth

## Validation and Verification
### Validation
- "Are we building the right product?"
- Demonstrate that the software meets its requirements

### Verification
- "Are we building the product right?"
- Also called Defect Testing
- To discover faults or defects in the software where its behaviour is incorrect or not in conformance with its specification
- **Successful** tests make the system perform incorrectly
    - expose a defect in the system

## Inspections and Testing
- Inspections and testing are complementary and not opposing verification techniques
- Both should be used during the V & V process
- Inspections can check conformance with a specification but not conformance with the customer's real requirements
- Inspections cannot check non-functional characteristics such as performance, usability, etc

## Stages of Testing
### Development testing
System is tested during development to discover bugs and defects

- All testing activities carried out by the team developing the system
    - Unit testing
        - individual program units (methods or classes) are tested
        - focus on correct functioning of objects or methods
    - Integration / Component testing
        - several units are integrated to create composite components
        - focus on testing component interfaces
    - System testing
        - some or all of the components in a system are integrated and the system is tested as a whole
        - focus on testing component interactions

#### System Testing
- Involves integrating components to create a version of the system and then testing the integrated system
- Focus is on testing interactions between components
- Checks that components are compatible, interact correctly and transfer the right data at the right time across their interfaces
- Tests the emergent behaviour of a system
- Components developed by different teams may be integrated at this stage
- Collective rather than an individual process
- In some companies, system testing may involve a separate testing team with no involvement from designers and programmers

#### Testing Policies
- Exhaustive system testing is impossible so testing policies which define the required system test coverage may be developed

### Release testing
Separate testing team test a complete version of the system before it is released to users

- Testing a particular release of a system that is intended for use outside of the development team
- Primary goal is to convince the supplier of the system that it is good enough for use
    - Show that the system delivers its specified
        - functionality
        - performance
        - dependability
        - does not fail during normal use
- Usually a black-box testing process where tests are derived from the system specification

#### Release Testing and System Testing
- Release testing is a form of system testing
- Release testing should be conducted by a team that was not involved in the system development
- System testing by the development team should focus on discovering bugs (verification, defect testing)
- Release testing determines if the system meets its requirements and is good enough for external use (validation)

### User testing
Users or potential users of a system test the system in their own environment

- User or customer testing is a stage in the testing process in which users or customers provide input and advice on system testing
- User testing is essential, even when comprehensive system and release testing have been carried out
    - Influences from the user's working environment have a major effect on the reliability, performance, usability and robustness of a system
        - cannot be replicated in a testing environment

#### Types of User Testing
- Alpha Testing
    - Users of the software work with the development team to test the software at the developer's site
- Beta Testing
    - A release of the software is made available to users to allow them to experiment and to raise problems that they discover with the system developers
- Acceptance Testing
    - Customers test a system to decide whether or not it is ready to be accepted from the system developers and deployed in the customer environment
        - primarily for custom systems

## Requirements Based Testing
- Requirements-based testing involves examining each requirement and developing a test or tests for it
    - functional requirements
    - non-functional requirements

## Use Cases and Release Testing
- Use cases describe functional requirements (these need to be validated during release testing)
- Generate test scripts and scenarios from use case descriptions
    - each sequence of events should generate at least one test script (typical and alternatives)
    - pre and post conditions must be tested
- Test scripts need to be traceable to their originating use case sequence of events

## Use Case Testing and Sequence Diagrams
- Sequence diagrams are usually associated with use cases
    - describe how the system model provides the functionality
- Can be used to drive integration and system testing
    - provides view of what software components to test
- Provides traceability between requirements, design, code and system tests

## Performance Testing
- Part of release testing may involve testing the emergent properties of a system (e.g. performance and reliability)
- Tests should reflect the profile of use of the system
- Performance tests usually involve planning a series of tests where the load is steadily increased until the system performance becomes unacceptable
- Stress testing is a form of performance testing where the system is deliberately overloaded to test its failure behaviour

## Regression Testing
- Check that changes have not 'broken' previously working code
    - applies to both development and release testing
- Manual testing -- regression testing is expensive
- Automated testing -- it is simple and straightforward
- All tests are rerun every time a change is made to the program
    - must run 'successfully' before the change is committed

### Test Automation
- Testing should be automated, as much as possible
- Write test drivers that execute the code being tested and capture the errors
- Rerun tests whenever changes are made to the code

## Agile Methods and Acceptance Testing
- Customer writes acceptance criteria for stories
    - ideally for stories going into the next iteration
- Developers turn these into automated test cases during the development iteration
    - working with customer to elaborate details of the criteria
- In theory no separate acceptance testing process
    - reality is the customer will still run through scenarios themselves on the system to do UAT
- Main problem here is whether or not the embedded user is 'typical' and can represent the interests of all system stakeholders

## Key Points
- Testing can only show the presence of errors in a program. It cannot demonstrate that there are no remaining faults
- Development testing is the responsibility of the software development team. A separate team should be responsible for testing a system before it is released to customers
- Development testing includes unit testing, in which you test individual object and methods component testing in which you test related groups of objects and system testing, in which you test partial or complete systems
- When testing software, you should try to 'break' the software by using experience and guidelines to choose types of test case that have been effective in discovering defects in other systems
- Wherever possible, you should write automated tests. The tests are embedded in a program that can be run every time a change is made to a system
- Test-first development is an approach to development where tests are written before the code to be tested
- Scenario testing involves inventing a typical usage scenario and using this to derive test cases
- Acceptance testing is a user testing process where the aim is to decide if the software is good enough to be deployed and used in its operational environment
