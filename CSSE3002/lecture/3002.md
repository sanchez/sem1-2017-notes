# Software Engineering
- Application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.
    - That is, the application of engineering to software.
    - IEEE Standard 610.12-1990
- Concerned with theories, methods and tools that enable professional software development.

"The topic that we call software engineering is both exciting and frustrating. Exciting because it draws on many technical disciplines and provides a harness that binds each discipline to the next. Frustrating, because it demands knowledge in a multitude of topic areas and seems to be infinitely expandable." - Roger Pressman, 1992

# Software Engineering Process
A structured set of activities followed to develop a software system

- Tools
- Methods
- Practices

## Well Engineered Software
- Usable
- Dependable
- Maintainable
- Efficient
- How do costs come into this?
    - Trade-offs may be involved
        - appropriate
        - cost-effective

# Process Models
- Abstract representation of a process
- Plan Driven
    - Structured / Traditional
- Incremental
- Agile
- Lean
- Formal

*Unified Process is allied closely with UML*

- Four distinct phases
    - Inception, Elaboration, Construction and Transition
- Considers activity balance across workflows and phases

- Process framework
    - process is instantiated from the framework
    - metamodel documents the framework
- Contracts between components
    - process construction
    - scheduling

## Agile Processes
- Scrum, XP, FDD, DSDM
- Embrace change
    - Requirements are never fixed
    - Stop pretending and get used to it
- Deliver early and deliver often
    - A working system delivers value
    - A deployed system generates revenue

## Lean Development
- More a philosophy than a process
    - Think Big
    - Act Small
    - Fail Fast
- Eliminate Waste
- Amplify Learning
- Decide as Late as Possible
- Deliver as Fast as Possible
- Empower the Team
- Build Integrity In
- See the Whole 

## Formal Processes
- Application of mathematical formality to software development
    - formal specification
    - transformation of specification to code

# Process
- All SE Processes involved phases
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Development (implementation, coding)
    - Testing (Verification)
    - Delivery and Maintenance
- These are never disjoint, never just sequential
- We iterate between them, and we blur the distinctions because we want to get it right
- Software Engineering cannot work without a defined development process
    - anything else is randomised hacking
- Processes cannot work if they are not usable
    - people don't read telephone books cover to cover
- Good processes should engage the team
    - support technical excellence and innovation
    - embed a culture of trust and responsibility

# Standards
- Rules, guidelines and heuristics
- De facto -- implicit agreement
    - easily changed
- De jure -- formal agreement
    - usually debated and documented

## Standard Adoption
- Voluntary
    - achieving good practice
    - safety net
- Required
    - demands of clients
    - certification requirements
    - follow on from other standards
    - process improvement activity

# What is Requirements Engineering
- Requirements engineering is a term often used for a systematic approach to acquire, analyse, validate, document and manage requirements
- Typically implemented as a cyclic or iterative process
- Requirements validation may include prototype construction and evaluation
- Applied at both system and software levels, often with interleaved system architecture design

## What is a Requirement?
1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
2. A condition by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification or other formally imposed document
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2

- There is a relationship between the quality / cost / timeliness / etc. of the product and the quality of the process
- Both functional and non-functional requirements are essential for successful software
    - Both must be verified
        - Consequently they must be testable
            - Non-functional Requirements should be measurable

## Requirements Engineering Products
- Primary outcome is a requirements specification
    - Essentially a contract between user and developer
    - Basis for all subsequent development and verification processes
- Secondary outcome is usually system and software acceptance test criteria

## Why is RE important?
- Most faults observed in a software project are from incorrect, incomplete, or misinterpreted functional specifications or requirements
- Helps earlier detection of mistakes, which are much more costly to correct if discovered later
- Forces clients to articulate and review requirements
- Enhances communications between participants
- Helps record and refine requirements
- All this is about producing good requirements

## Advice/Perspective
- â€¦ a systematic approach to finding, documenting, organizing, and tracking the changing requirements of a system
- In practice it is impossible to produce a complete and consistent requirements document
- Getting the requirements right is critical for success
- Requirements are rarely right at the start of a large project
    - Expect change
    - Manage it
    - Agile mantra "Embrace Change"

## Functional Requirements
- Requirements (or capabilities) for functions (specific behaviour) that must be performed by the system
    - e.g. read a bar code, change a user name
- Primary focus of most requirements activities

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Constraints on performance or quality

### Product Properties
- Requirements on the behaviour of the product
    - System shall process a minimum of 8 transactions per second
    - User credit card details shall be secured

### Process Properties
- Requirements on the practices used to develop / produce the system
    - Control software shall be verified in accordance with IEEE STD 1012-1998

## Classification of Non-Functional Requirements
According to the ISO standard

- Safety requirements
- Security requirements
- Interface requirements
- Human engineering requirements
- Qualification requirements
- Operational requirements
- Maintenance requirements
- Design constraints

## Sources of Requirements
- Users
    - e.g. customers or end-users -- user requirements
- Other Stakeholders
    - e.g. marketing experts, regulators, managers, business owners, developers
- Non-Human Sources
    - e.g. other devices or systems in the environment

## The Requirements Engineering Process

  {rankdir=TB};
  a [label="Requirements Elicitation and Analysis"];

}

## Summary
- Requirements engineering is concerned with eliciting, analysing, documenting, validating and managing requirements
- The process, and the specification it produces, is the primary link between the user and the system developer
- The requirements specification is also the basis for all subsequent development activity, and must guide all decisions that determine the resultant product quality
- Requirements engineering is the key to product quality
