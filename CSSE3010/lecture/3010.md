# Analog Interfacing
## Accuracy, Precision, Resolution
### Accuracy
Proximity of measurement results to the true value

### Precision
Repeatability or reproducibility of the measurement

### Measurement resolution
The smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement

## Sampling
### Time Quantization
Signal value read/available only in specific times (usually at the same interval). This can cause aliasing -- frequency ambiguity of signal components

### Amplitude Quantisation
Amplitude of each sample can only take one of a finite number of different values. This adds **quantisation noise**: an irreversible corruption of the signal

## Sampling Theorem
### Nyquist Theorem
A signal having no spectral components above $f_m$ Hz can be determined uniquely by values sampled at the rate: $$f_s > 2f_m$$
$f_s > 2f_m$ is called the Nyquist rate

### Aperture time
The time during which ADC is continuously converting the varying analog input
$$ \text{Max slope} = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} = \omega\times V_{peak} = 2\pi f V_{peak}$$

#### Example
\begin{align*}
\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t} &= 2\pi f V_{peak} \tag{$f=(\Delta V/\Delta t)(1/2\pi V_{peak})$}\\
\Delta V &= \frac{1}{4} LSB = \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{10V}{4096}\right) = 0.6 mV\\
\Delta t &= 10us\\
f &= \left(\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2\pi V_{peak}}\right) = \left(\frac{0.6mV}{10us}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2\pi5V}\right) = 2Hz
\end{align*}

### Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)
 - Ratio of the maximum sine wave level to the noise level
 - Maximum sine wave has an amplitude of $\pm2^{n-1}$ which equals an RMS value of: $$0.71\times 2^{n-1} = 0.35\times2^n$$
 - SNR is: $$20\log_{10}\left(\frac{0.35\times2^n}{0.3}\right) = 20\log_{10}(1.2\times2^n) = 1.8+6n\ dB$$

## Conclusions
- Interface to analogue world requires thorough understanding and analysis of physical properties this is why it is difficult
- The A/D D/A on-chip converters on microcontrollers are average precision and would require off chip hardware to make conversions more accurate or faster
- Always start interfacing with analysis of the properties and requirements of the analogue side. Digital is always faster

# Timing Interfacing
- Use of timing bistate (high or low) waveforms or 'square wave' for interfacing
- A timing waveform can 'mimic' an analog voltage
    - Note Analog voltages an be approximated with specific square waves frequencies and duty cycle
- Commonly used for Pulse Width Modulation, Waveform Frequency or Time Spacing Interfaces
- Timing Interfacing consists of three parameters:
    - Period
    - Frequency
    - Duty Cycle

## Waveform Basics
- Period (s) $= T_{high} + T_{low} = T_{period}$
- Frequency (Hz) $= \frac{1}{T_{period}}$
- Duty Cycle (\%) $= \frac{100\times T_{high}}{T_{high}+T_{low}} = 100\times\frac{T_{high}}{T_{period}}$

### Waveform Time Spacing Measurement
- Time spacing of a waveform used to convey information
- Useful for 'irregular' waveforms (high low times are not the same)
    - E.g. time spacing between pulses
- Implemented using Timer Input Capture interrupts
    - A timer counter value is recorded, each time a transition (rising or falling) occurs on the input line
### Frequency Measurement
- The frequency of a waveform can also convey information
- Useful for 'regular' waveforms (High and low times are the same)
- Typically used for optical or mechanical based systems

#### Example: Wheel Encoder
The wheel encoder works by shining light through a pin wheel and detecting the frequency of the light passing through. The frequency of the light passing through is proportional to the speed of the wheel

### Waveform Frequency/Period Measurement
- Implemented using Timer Input Capture interrupts
- Can measure using period/frequency by timing transitions.

    Disadvantage: Must rely on accurate timer with enough resolution/precision (e.g. 1ns resolution)
- The number of transitions or zero crossings within a time window, is proportional to the waveform frequency/period.

    Advantage: Does not need high resolution.

    Disadvantage: Only works for regular waveforms

## Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) uses duty cycle to convey information
- PWM can be used approximate analog (multi-value) waveforms
- Used for controlling mechanical systems such as motors and servo motors

### PWM precision/resolution
$$period = N\times\Delta$$

$\Delta=$ resolution

$N=$ PWM precision

#### Example:
$$Period\ 20ms, \Delta = 20us \rightarrow N = 1000 \rightarrow 10bits$$

# Timer
Timers features:

- Update interrupts -- cause an update interrupt (periodic or not)
- PWM -- pulse width modulation (used for controlling servos)
- Timer Input Capture interrupts -- cause an interrupt, when a rising or falling edge is detected on an input signal -- captures value of timer
- Timer Output Compare -- toggle an output pin high or low, when a compare value matches the timer value

# ADC
- 3 ADCs: ADC1 (master), ADC2 and ADC3 (slaves)
- Maximum frequency of the ADC analog clock is 36MHz
- 12-bits, 10-bits, 8-bits or 6-bits configurable resolution
- ADC conversion rate with 12 bit resolution is up to:
    - 2.4 M.samples/s in single ADC mode
    - 4.5 M.samples/s in dual interleaved ADC mode
    - 7.2 M.samples/s in triple interleaved ADC mode
- Conversion range: 0 to 3.6 V
- ADC supply requirement: VDDA = 2.4V to 3.6V at full speed and down to 1.65V at lower speed
- 3 ADC1 internal channels connected to:
    - Temperature sensor
    - Internal voltage reference: Vrefint (1.2V typ)
- External trigger option for both regular and injected conversion
- Single and continuous conversion modes
- Scan mode for automatic conversion of channel 0 to channel 'n'
- Left or right data alignment with in-built data coherency
- Channel by channel programmable sampling time
- Discontinuous mode
- Dual/Triple mode (with ADC1 and ADC2 or all 3 ADCs)
- DMA capability
- Analog Watchdog on high and low thresholds
- Interrupt generation on:
    - End of Conversion
    - End of Injected conversion
    - Analog watchdog
    - Overrun

# Embedded Design Methodology
## Top Down Design
- Embedded System design methodology
    - A complex system is created to meet specific design attributes
- Top down is a process in which a complex design is first organised as a top or high level view
    - The high level overview of the design is divided into sub-components
    - Each sub-componenet is a distinct section of the top level design
        - The sub-components can be further broken down into elements

## High Level Design Overview
Consists of a number of concepts:

- System Flow:
    - Schematic -- shows system inputs and outputs connections
    - Signal/Data Flow diagram
        - Shows the connections of the inputs, all the way to the outputs
            - Shows each stage of connecting the input to the output
- Program Flow:
    - State Diagrams
        - Embedded System Programming main loop can be abstracted as a State Controller
            - A microcontroller program must enter and exit certain states, as it executes
    - Flow Charts
        - Software abstraction of microcontroller program

### System Flow -- Signal/Data Flow
- Signal/Data Flow diagram
    - Shows the connections of the inputs, all the way to the outputs
- Shows each stage of connecting the input to the output
- Differs to block diagram -- is not an overview of the system
- Useful for identifying which software/hardware modules to use
- Useful for debugging and identifying:
    - Break points -- where your code will definitely break
    - Weak points -- where your code could potentially break
    - Bottle necks -- where your system's performance is limited -- i.e. 'slow' to respond

## Program Flow
Your program flow should consist of:

- Main loop
- Hardware Initialisation function
- Functions -- callable block of code
- Subroutine (not a function but a unit of code)
- Interrupt Service Routines

Program flow is described as:

- State Diagrams
    - main loop
- Flow Charts
    - subroutines
