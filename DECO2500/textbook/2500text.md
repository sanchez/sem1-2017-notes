### The Process of Interaction Design
1. Establishing requirements
1. Designing alternatives
1. Prototyping
1. Evaluating

## The User Experience (UX)
Nielsen and Norman (2014) define it as encompassing "all aspects fo the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products." You cannot design a user experience, you can only design for the user experience. There are many aspects of the user experience that can be considered and ways of taking them into account when designing interactive products.

- Usability
- Functionality
- Aesthetics
- Content
- Look and Feel
- Sensual
- Emotional
- Fun
- Health
- Social Capital
- Cultural Identity

### Four Core Threads
McCarthy and Wright propose four core threads that make up our holistic experiences:

- **The sensual thread**. This is concerned with our sensory engagement with a situation and is similar to the visceral level of Norman's model. It can be equated with the level of absorption people have with various technological devices and applications, most notable being computer games, smartphones, and chat rooms, where users can be highly absorbed in their interactions at a sensory level. These can involve thrill, fear, pain, and comfort.
- **The emotional thread**. Common examples of emotions that spring to mind are sorrow, anger, joy and happiness. In addition, the framework points out how emotions are intertwined with the situation in which they arise -- e.g. a person becomes angry with a computer because it does not work properly. Emotions also invoke making judgements of value. For example, when purchasing a new cell phone, people may be drawn to the ones that are most cool-looking but be in an emotional turmoil because they are the most expensive. They can't really afford them but they really would like one of them.
- **The compositional thread**. This is concerned with the narrative part of an experience, as it unfolds, and the way a person makes sense of it. For example, when shopping online, the options laid out to people can lead them in a coherent way to making a desired purchase or they can lead to frustrating experiences resulting in no purchase being made. When in this situation, people ask themselves questions such as: What is this about? What would happen if...? The compositional thread is the internal thinking we do during our experiences.
- **The spatio-temporal thread**. This refers to the space and time in which our experiences take place and their effect upon those experiences. There are many ways of thinking about space and time and their relationship with one another: for example, we talk of time speeding up, standing still, and slowing down, whilw we talk of space in terms of public and personal places, and needing one's own space.

## Usability Goals
- effective to use (effectiveness)
- efficient to use (efficiency)
- safe to use (safety)
- having good utility (utility)
- easy to learn (learnability)
- easy to remember how to use (memorability)

### Design Principles
Design principles are used by interaction designers to aid their thinking when designing for the user experience.

- **Feedback:** products should be designed to provide adequate feedback to the users to ensure they know what to do next in their tasks
- **Findability:** the degree to which a particular object is easy to discover or locate -- be it navigating a website, moving through a building, or finding the delete image option on digital camera
- **Visibility:** the more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know to do next
- **Constraints:** the design concept of constraining refers to determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment (e.g. greying a menu item)
- **Consistency:** design interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks
- **Affordance:** used to refer to an attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it (e.g. a mouse button invites pushing, in doing so activating clicking, by the way it is physically constrained)

## Summary
### Key points
- Interaction design is concerned with designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives
- Interaction design is multidisciplinary, involving many inputs from wide-ranging disciplines and fields
- The notion of the user experience is central to interaction design
- Optimizing the interaction between users and interactive products requires taking into account a number of interdependent factors, including context of use, types of activity, accessibility, cultural differences, and user groups
- Identifying and specifying relevant usability and user experience goals can help lead to the design of good interactive products
- Design principles, such as feedback and simplicity, are useful heuristics for analysing and evaluating aspects of an interactive product

## Examples
### Marble Answering Machine (Durrel Bishop, 1995)
Incoming messages are represented using physical marbles. The number of marbles that have moved into the pinball-like chute indicates the number of messages. Dropping one of these marbles into a slot in the machine causes the recorded message to play. Dropping the same marble into another slot on the phone dials the caller who left the message

### Minuum Online Keyboard
Easy way of typing using minimal buttons. Similar to Wii remotes where you point to a row of keys and type that way. This is faster to use on a small device, especially with one hand

# Chapter 2 -- Understanding and Conceptualizing Interaction
- Explain what is meant by the problem space
- Explain how to conceptualize interaction
- Describe what a conceptual model is and how to begin to formulate one
- Discuss the use of interface metaphors as part of a conceptual model
- Outline the core interaction types for informing the development of a conceptual model
- Introduce paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks informing interaction design

## Understanding the Problem Space and Conceptualizing Interaction
Having a good understanding of the problem space greatly helps design teams to then be able to conceptualize the design space. Primarily this involves articulating the proposed system and the user experience. The benefits of conceptualizing the design space early on are:

- **Orientation** -- enabling the design team to ask specific kinds of questions about how the conceptual model will be understood by the targeted users
- **Open-mindedness** -- preventing the design team from becoming narrowly focused early on
- **Common ground** -- allowing the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on

## Conceptual Models
In a nutshell, a conceptual model provides a working strategy and a framework of general concepts and their interrelations. The core components are:

- Metaphors and analogies that convey to people how to understand what a product is for and how to use it for an activity (e.g. browsing, bookmarking)
- The concepts that people are exposed to through the product, including the task -- domain objects they create and manipulate, their attributes, and the operations that can be performed on them (e.g. saving, revisiting, organizing)
- The relationships between those concepts (e.g. whether one object contains another, the relative importance of actions to others, and whether an object is part of another)
- The mappings between the concepts and the user experience the product is designed to support or invoke (e.g. one can revisit through looking at a list of visited sites, most-frequently visited, or saved websites)

### Design Concept
Design concept is essentially a set of ideas for a design. Typically is comprises of scenarios, images, mood boards, or text-based documents.

## Interface Metaphors
Metaphors are considered to be a central component of a conceptual model. They provide a structure that is similar in some way to aspects of a familiar entity (or entities) but also have their own behaviours and properties. More specifically, an interface metaphor is one that is instantiated in some way as part of the user interface.\
Metaphors and analogies are used in three main ways:

1. As a way of conceptualizing what we are doing (e.g. surfing the web)
1. As a conceptual model instantiated at the interface (e.g. the card metaphore)
1. As a way of visualizing an operation (e.g. an icon of a shopping cart into which we place items we wish to purchase on an online shopping site)

## Interaction Types
The way a user will interact with a product or application. Four main types of interaction:

- **Instructing** -- where users issue instructions to a system. This can be done in a number of ways, including: typing in commands, selecting options from menus in a windows environment or on a multitouch screen, speaking aloud commands, gesturing, pressing buttons, or using a combination of function keys
- **Conversing** -- where users have a dialog with a system. Users can speak via an interface or type in questions to which the system replies via text or speech output
- **Manipulating** -- where users interact with objects in a virtual or physical space by manipulating them (e.g. opening, holding, closing, placing). User can hone their familiar knowledge of how to interact with objects
- **Exploring** -- where users move through a virtual environment or a physical space. Vritual environments include 3D worlds, and augmented and virtual reality systems. They enable users to hone their familiar knowledge of physically moving around. Physical spaces that use sensor-based technologies include smart rooms and ambient environments, also enabling people to capitalize on familiarity

## Paradigms, Visions, Theories, Models, and Frameworks
(Carrol, 2003)

- **Paradigm** refers to a general approach that has been adopted by a community of researchers and designers for carrying out their work, in terms of shared assumptions, concepts, values, and practices
- **Vision** is a future scenario that frames research and development in interaction design -- often depicted in the form of a film or a narrative
- **Theory** is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of a phenomenon
- **Model** is a simplification of some aspect of human-computer interaction intended to make it easier for designers to predict and evaluate alternative designs
- **Framework** is a set of interrelated concepts and/or a set of specific questions that are intended to inform a particular domain area (e.g. collaborative learning), online communities, or an analytic method (e.g. ethnographic studies)

## Summary
### Key Points
- It is important to have a good understanding of the problem space, specifying what it is you are doing, why, and how it will support users in the way intended
- A fundamental aspect of interaction design is to develop a conceptual model
- A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of what users can do with it and the concepts they need in order to understand how to interact with it
- Decisions about conceptual design should be made before commencing physical design (e.g. choosing menus, icons, dialog boxes)
- Interface metaphors are commonly used as part of a conceptual model
- Interaction types (e.g. conversing, instructing) provide a way of thinking about how best to support the activities users will be doing when using a product or service
- Paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks provide different ways of framing and informing design and research

## Examples
### The Star (Xerox, 1981)
The Star interface revolutionized the way interfaces were designed for personal computing. Based on the conceptual model of an office; paper, folders, filing cabinets, mailboxes. 

### Direct Manipulation (Shneiderman, 1983)
Proposes that digital objects be designed at the interface so that they can be interacted with in ways that are analogous to how physical objects in the physical world are manipulated. Users feel that they are directly controlling the digital objects. The benefits of direct manipulation:

- helping beginners learn basic functionality rapidly
- enabling experienced users to work rapidly on a wide range of tasks
- allowing infrequent users to remember how to carry out operations over time
- preventing the need for error messages, except very rarely
- showing users immediately how their actions are furthering their goals
- reducing users' experiences of anxiety
- helping users gain confidence and mastery and feel in control

### Ubiquitous Technology (Weiser, 1991)
He proposed that computers would become part of the environment, embedded in a variety of everyday objects, devices, and displays. The technology would be able to enter our attention when needed and leave when it was finished, constantly running unnoticed in the background

### Apple's 1987 Knowledge Navigator
Presented a scenario of a professor using a touch-screen tablet with a speech-based intelligent assistant reminding him of what he needed to do that day while answering the phone and helping him prepare his lectures. It was 25 years ahead of its time (set in 2011), the actual year that Apple launched its speech system, Siri

### New Challenges, Themes, and Questions (Rogers, 2006, Harper et al, 2008)
Many new challenges, themes, and questions have been articulated through these visions, including:

- How to enable people to access and interact with information in their work, social, and everyday lives, using an assortment of technologies
- How to design user experiences for people using interfaces that are part of the environment but where there are no obvious controlling devices
- How and in what form to provide contextually relevant information to people at appropriate times and places to support them while on the move
- How to ensure that information that is passed around via interconnected displays, devices, and objects is secure and trustworthy

### Relationship between conceptual model and user's understanding (Norman, 1988)
- The designer's model -- the model the designer has of how the system should work
- The system image -- how the system actually works is portrayed to the user through the interface, manuals, help facilities, and so on
- The user's model -- how the user understands how the system works
