# What are HCI and ID
## Human-computer interaction (HCI)
Concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them
\
\

One set of usability principles (Norman 1998):

Visibility
: can you see your options for action? *Externalising cognition -- Gulf of Execution*

Feedback
: can you see the effect of what you did? *Goal directed activity -- Gulf of Evaluation*

Constraints
: is your activity usefully shaped towards successful paths? *Focusing attention -- Gulf of Execution*

Mapping
: is there a natural relation between your actions and their effects on the world? *Mental model -- Gulf of Execution*

Consistency
: are there similar operations and similar elements for similar tasks? *Learning and memory -- Gulf of Execution*

Affordance
: do interfacce elements correctly "signal" how they are to be used? *Gulf of Execution*
\

Another set of usability principles (Nielsen 2001):

- Visibility of system status -- *Externalising cognition*
- Match between system and real world -- *Mental model*
- User control and freedom -- *Goal-directed activity*
- Consistency and standards -- *Learning and memory*
- Error prevention -- *Focusing attention*
- Recognition rather than recall -- *Learning and memory*
- Flexibility and efficiency of use -- *Information processing*
- Aesthetic and minimalist design -- *see Emotional design* <!-- TODO: Put link here -->
- Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors -- *Goal-directed activity (7-stages)*
- Help and documentation

## Interaction Design (ID)
Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives

### Key Components of ID process
- Establishing user requirements
- Developing alternatives
- Prototyping
- Evaluating

~~~

Users shoud be involved throughout the project. Specific usability and user experience goals should be identified, clearly documented and agreed at start of project, and *tracked empirically throughout development*. Iteration is needed through the core activities

Help designers:

- Match what people want, need, and may desire
- Appreciate that one size does not fit all (e.g. teenagers very different from adults)
- Correct incorrect assumptions about user groups (e.g. not all old people want or need big fonts)
- Know people's sensitivities and capabilities

## Architecture vs Engineering Analogy (ID vs soft engg)
Architects are specialists in how people will interact with spaces. Engineers are specialists in specifying and constructing the spaces

# User Experience (UX)
How people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opening or closing it. It includes their overall impression of how good it is to use, right down to the sensual effect small details have on them, such as how smoothly a switch rotates or the sound of a click and the touch of a button when pressing it

*Can't design user experience; can only design for it*

# Usability Goals
- Effective to use
- Efficient to use
- Safe to use
- Have good utility
- Easy to learn
- Easy to remember how to use

# Understanding and Conceptualising Interaction
1. Explain what is meant by the problem space
2. Explain how to conceptualize interaction
3. Describe what a conceptual model is and how to formulate one
4. Discuss interface metaphors as part of a conceptual model
5. Outline core interaction types for informing development of a conceptual model

## Conceptual Design
Processing of transforming user and functional requirements into a conceptual model before starting physical design. "Designing what to design"

1. Problem space
2. Conceptual model
3. Interface metaphor
4. Design space

### Intial Problem Space
"In the process of creating an interactive product, it can be tempting to begin at the nuts and bolts level of design...better to make thses kinds of decisions after articulating the nature of the problem space; (that is, after) understanding and conceptualizing what is currently the user experience/product and how this is going to be improved or changed" Preece et al., p.37

- Question the assumptions
- Challenge the claims
    - Are there problems with existing product or user experience?
    - If so, what are they?
    - Why do you think there are problems?
    - How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these?
    - If designing for a new user experience how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things?
- Get others to challenge your ideas -- hard to do it yourself

## Conceptual Model
- **Will the user understand the underlying conceptual model?**

"A description of the proposed system in terms of a set of integrated ideas and concepts about what it should do, behave and look like, that will be understandable by the users in the manner intended." (Preece, et al., 2002)
\
\
Three considerations when developing a conceptual model:

1. Interaction paradigm -- ICT framework experienced
    - ICT framework within which interaction takes place (WIMP, mobile, ubiquitous computing, etc)
    - May be familar or novel to user
2. Interaction mode/type -- what does the user have to DO?
    - How does the user interact with the system?
    - Helps user know what to do, in particular
3. Interface metaphor -- exploiting user experience
    - How is the user's prior knowledge used?
    - Helps user know what to do and how to interpret feedback

- Not same as "user interface"
    - It's the concepts people need to understand in order to *use* the interface
- Not same as "user's mental model"
    - It's the conceptual basis for the user's mental model
- Not same as "use-cases"
    - It focuses on *system as a whole*, not individual tasks
- Not same as "implementation architecture"
    - It involves *abstract* constructs, not technical or implementation-level constructs

### Formulating a Conceptual Model
- **Will the user understand the underlying conceptual model?**
- What will users be doing when carrying out tasks?
- How will the system support those activities?
- What kind of *interface metaphor* is appropriate?
- What kinds of *interaction modes* and styles to use?

### Interaction mode/interaction type
- Giving instructions
    - Issuing commands using keyboard and selecting options via menus
- Conversing
    - Interacting with the system as if having a conversation
- Manipulating and navigating
    - Acting on objects and interacting with virtual objects
- Exploring and browsing
    - Finding out and learning things

### Interface metaphor
"This works like a ..."

# Cognition
Cognition is operations involved with sensing and functioning mentally in the world

- Attention
- Perception and recognition
- Memory
- Cognition -- internal or personal
    - Mental models
    - Gulfs of execution and evaluation
    - Information processing
- Cognition -- external or shared
    - Distributed cognition
    - External cognition

## Attention
- Processes by which we focus our minds and our senses on one thing/set of things from all possibilities around us
    - Visual attention (usually works serially)
    - Auditory attention (eyes-free, time-shared)
    - Focal/focused attention
    - Divided attention
    - Pre-attentive processes (not in full focal attention)
    - Peripheral awareness (background awareness)
- "Attention-aware computing"
- "Cocktail party effect"
- Possible to perform multiple tasks without one or more of them suffering?
- Depends on task and individual differences
- Heavy vs light multi-taskers
    - Heavy more distractible than light
    - Heave find it difficult to filter irrelevant information
- "Distracted doctoring"/"Distracted driving"

## Perception and recognition
How information is acquired from world through senses and transformed into experience

## Memory
We encode and then retrieve knowledge. We remember what we have attended to. Context is an important cue to memory retrieval. We recognize things

## Myth of 7 +/- 2 in design
- Miller's (1956) theory of how much information people can remember
- Based on how many items you can remember from a spoken or briefly shown list (average = 7 +/- 2)
- But some designers say:
    - "Present only 7 options on a menu"
    - "Display only 7 icons on a tool bar"
    - "Place only 7 tabs on the top of a website page"

This is wrong!

## Information-processing Metaphor
\dot(IPMetaphor {width=100%})(Information-processing metaphor)
~~~
digraph {
    rankdir=LR;
    "input or\nstimuli" -> "Encoding\n(Stage 1)" -> "Comparison\n(Stage 2)" -> "Response\nselection\n(Stage 3)" -> "Response\nexecution\n(Stage 4)" -> "output or\nresponse";
}
~~~

Stages of processing assumed:

- Stage 1 and Stage 4 -- Modaltiy of input and output affects performance
- Stage 2 and Stage 3 -- Options to select amongst affect performance

### Information Processing Models
"Model Human Processor"

- Based on mental activities only
- Models human interacting with computer
- Estimates time to do tasks
- Models highly constrained tasks -- telephone operators
- Does not model how people interact with computers and other devices in less constrained contexts

GOMS -- Card, Moran & Newell (1983)
- Goals (what you're trying to achieve)
- Operators (actions you can do)
- Methods (ways to assemble Operators)
- Selection rules (ways to choose Methods)

## Cognitive Frameworks For HCI
Cognitive frameworks for HCI are concepts and models that explain cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction and interaction design issues

# Mental Models
- User develops understanding of system through learning about and using it
- User's knowledge is somtimes described as "mental model":
    - How to use the system
    - How to handle unfamiliar system or unexpected situations
- People make inferences using mental models
- Mental models often wrong or only partially right
- Refrigerator example

## Seven Stages of aciton
\dot(SevenStages {width=100%})(Seven stages of action)

digraph {

    subgraph cluster_0 {
        label="Gulf of Execution";
        Intention -> Action -> Execution;
    }

    subgraph cluster_1 {
        label="Gulf of Evaluation";
        Evaluation -> Interpretation -> Perception;
    }

    Goals -> Intention [constraint=false];
    Evaluation -> Goals [constraint=true];

    Execution -> "Physical Activity in the World" [constraint=false];
    "Physical Activity in the World" -> Perception [constraint=true];
}
~~~

Norman's (1986) seven stages of action. "Seven stages" decompose interaction into steps. Each step may be well or poorly supported

### Gulf of Execution
Difference between user's formulation of actions to reach a goal and actions allowed by system. If actions allowed by system match user's intention, then interaction will be effective.

### Gulf of Evaluation
Distance between physical presentation of system state and expectation of user. If user can readily evaluate presentation in terms of goals, the gulf of evaluation is small

## External Cognition
Explains how we interact with external respresentations (e.g. maps, notes, diagrams, tools, instruments, notations). How they extend our cognition. How they help us solve difficult problems

## Distributed Cognition
- Shared/distributed problem-solving that takes place
- Role of verbal and *non-verbal* behaviour
- Coordinating mechanisms people use (e.g. rules, procedures)
- Communication that takes place as collaborative activity progresses
- How knowledge is shared and accessed
    - Taking bearings in narrow waterways
    - Micronesian navigation across the Pacific
- How cognitive phenomena work across individuals, artifacts, and internal and external representations (Hutchins, 1995)
- Propagation across representational states
- Information *transformed* through different media (computers, displays, paper, heads)
- Role of verbal and non-verbal behaviour

# Conversation analysis
Fundamentals of conversations:

- Openings and greetings
- Personal space/distance
- Topic introduction
- Turntaking
- Making disclosures
- Admitting others
- Trouble and repair
- Closings and farewells

## Rules
Sacks et al. (1978) describe three rules:

Rule 1
: current speaker chooses next speaker by asking opinion, question, or request

Rule 2
: another person decides to start speaking

Rule 3
: the current speaker continues talking

## Affordances of Media
- How does different media affect the fundamentals and pragmatics of conversation?
    - Compare how you finish a conversation on an audio-only channel (phone call) vs an audiovisual channel (Facetime, Skype, etc)
    - Compare how you correct a misunderstanding on email vs on a phone call vs on Facetime or Skype
- How do we select amongst different media for conversations of different kinds?
    - Number of other people
    - Familiarity with other people
    - Sensitivity of issue to be discussed
    - Simplicity/complexity of issue/purpose of communication

## Telepresence
- Shared space
- 3 by 8 ft 'picture-window' between two sites with video and audio
- People interacted but strange things happened (Kraut, 1990)
    - Talked constantly about system
    - Spoke more to people in same room than in other room
    - When tried to get closer to someone in other place had opposite effect -- went out of range of camera and microphone
- Technologies designed to allow a person to feel as if they were present in the other location
    - Projecting body movements, actions, voice and facial expressions to other location or person
- Superimpose images of other person on a workspace
    - Transparent board that shows other person's facial expression on your board as you draw
        - Users did not feel comfortable "looking down" at the other person
- Most forms of videoconferencing lead to:
    - Longer conversational turns
    - Fewer interruptions of each other
    - Turn-taking more explicit
    - Greetings and farewells longer and more ritualised
- Video gives more intimacy than audio phone
- Low overhead to adopt
- Works in personal spaces
- Works well for already-acquainted people but also lets people get to know each other

# Presence
## Lifelogging
- Low cost audiovisual data collection and storage
- Can go beyond perpetual sharing and broadcasting of personal information to lifelogging

## Google Glass
- Socially and cognitively problematic
- Distraction issues (display), privacy issues (forward camera)
- Banned in cars, cinemas, theatres, casinos, strip clubs, restaurants, cafes, etc
- "Glassholes"
- Current focus on enterprise applications only

## Online Presence
- Rapid switching between media and applications to notify and be notified
- Selection of medium for message type, speed, cost, and urgency

## Awareness Mechanisms
Involves knowing who is around, what is happening, and who it talking to whom

- Peripheral awareness
    - Keeping an eye on things happening in the periphery of vision
    - Overhearing and overseeing -- allows tracking of what others are doing without explicit cues
- Notification systems
    - User notify others as opposed to being constantly monitored
    - Provide information about shared objects and progress of collaborative tasks

# Key Points
## Chapter 1
- Interaction design is designing interactive products to support how people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives
- Interaction design is multidisciplinary
- User Experience is central to interaction design
- "Optimizing" interaction requires taking into account context of use, types of activity, accessibility, cultural difference, and user groups
- Specifying usability and user experience goals helps design of good products
- Design principles are useful heuristic for analyzing and evaluating an interactive product

## Chapter 3
- Social media change how we organise and conduct our lives
- Communications technology changes how we interact with each other:
    - We adjust to the new affordances or the removal of affordances in new forms of communication
- Social mechanisms have evolved to smooth out conversations, assist coordination of activities, and support mutual awareness of each others' activities
- Focus on
    - Conversations
    - Telepresence
    - Awareness mechanisms
